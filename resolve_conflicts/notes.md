# Resolving Host Conflicts

In general, I believe that we should resolve these conflicts by taking the most recent pericenter. Making decisions based on $V_{\rm{max}}$ or $M_{200m}$ or proximity will introduce arbitrary decisions that are not necessarily tied to the dynamics of the tracers, which feels like it's deviating from the goal of introducing a new subhalo definition.

## Scenario 1:

Consider a scenario like this, where the red halo has a pericenter $P_1$ around green, and then has another pericenter around the blue, infalling halo $P_2$. I think the red halo should be distinct until $P_1$, and then from $P_1 \rightarrow P_2$ a subhalo of green, then after $P_2$ a subhalo of blue.

There's a fair argument about forcing the red halo to remain green's subhalo despite the pericenter around the smaller blue halo. Intuitively, since red is likely to become a subhalo of green soon anyway, this might make sense. However, we try to avoid making decisions about the status of subhalos based on their long-term prospects, since we won't have that available to us in observations / at low redshift in simulations.

However, if we consider the relationships between the three halos at this snapshot, I would 

## Scenario 2:

</p>

Scenario 2 is very reminiscent of scenario 1. However, now blue has had a pericenter around green before the red pericenter around blue. Since blue is also a subhalo of green, we simply consider red still a subhalo of green as well.

A knock-on effect from this might be when a parent-subhalo pair fall into a halo. The host may have a pericenter before the subhalo does, in which case the subhalo may join the orbiting population early to some. I still think that this decision is logical from the perspective of considering the parent-subhalo system's pericenter is likely near the host's.

## Three-Body Interactions
Does SPARTA track the dynamics of second-order subhalos w.r.t the host?

Should I worry about scenarios where three-body interactions cause a second-order subhalo to leave the system?

## Simultaneous Pericenters

In this unlikely scenario, we will probably have to resort to whichever is the most massive halo.
